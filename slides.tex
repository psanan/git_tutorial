%% TODO:
% Some misc notes:
git:

%Where it comes from (parable) 
%eWhat you can do with it
%eWhy it’s better than subversion
%e  cheap branching
%eWhat’s bad about it, and how to mitigate those factors
%e  dumb syntax
%eGUIs and web tools
%eHow to learn more
%e
%eGood habits it encourages
%e  Working on atomic units of progress
%e  Summarizing and explaining what you’re doing
%e  Making your progress visible to other people [esp. remote collaborators]
%e  Writing to be shared and extended
%e  Moving between working states
%e  Backing up remotely
%e  Maintaining a canonical version (“upstream”) of a project
%e
%eThe main objective:
%e  Overcome the energy barrier to learn and become comfortable with the tools.

\section{Who am I?}
%% Can start with who the audience is. Specifically, it's the GFD group,
%%  but more generally it's the class of people who use computers in their work
%%  but are much more interested in what computers can do for them than how
%%  computers work. They can use a terminal, and are scientific, but 
%%  crucially they are NOT interested in cleverness, or hacking, or doing
%%  something because it's cool.

\section{What is git?}
%% Give what I just said, it might seem silly that I am going so start with 
%% a low-level description of what git does. Why? As much as I hate to do it, 
%% here's the xkcd cartoon.

%% I hated this cartoon when I saw it. Because I love git and think it makes total
%% sense. But I didn't always. So, let's start with ..
%%
%% A false history of version control [based loosely on ``a git parable'' ..
%% ...
%% [Along the way, we introduce functinality, which we label as {A},{B}, etc. Later, we show how this is practically manifested in git]
%% {A} Save labelled versions of your work, so that you can return to it at any time

%% {B} Maintain a 'tree' (better thought of as a DAG)

%% Now we should have a good idea of what git is

\section{How do I use it?}
%% So how do we use it????

%% 0. Getting it. This is often the hardest part about learning software. Getting it running on your machine.
%% 
%% I am going to assume now that you know how to use a terminal to navigate around your local file system [!! Am I going to assume this?? Hmm.. Depends how hands-on I want this to be ..]
%%

%% Due diligence for the examples
%% All examples are located at ...
%% The version of git used was XXX, on this operating system YYY..

%% 1. Working on your own local project
%%
%% [Here and elsewhere, we refer back to the abstract things that we set up in the first section]
%% {A}, saving labelled version of your own work.
%% ...
%% {B} As you work, you build up a tree (a linear one for now) 
%%
%% How can you see this tree?
%%%

%% ...

%% Remote tools ..

%% So now that I can use this thing, how will it make my life better? 

%% Wiping out a file completely

\section{What can I do with it?}

%% Working with latex. Here's a .gitignore. Recommendation: put sentences on new lines.

%% Working on code which needs to run on many different machines. 

%% Having a canonical version of something.

%% Free backups and transfers!

%% Coordinating with a team

%% Contributing to a project
